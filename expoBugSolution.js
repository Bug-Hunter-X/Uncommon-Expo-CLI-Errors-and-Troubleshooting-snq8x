The solution to Expo CLI errors varies widely.  However, here are some common steps:

1. **Verify Node.js and npm/yarn versions:** Ensure you have compatible versions of Node.js and either npm or yarn installed.  Outdated or incompatible versions can cause conflicts.  Check the Expo documentation for the recommended versions.

2. **Check project setup:** Double-check that your project's `package.json` and `app.json` are correctly configured. Any inconsistencies here may cause issues. Look for missing or incorrect dependencies.

3. **Clear Expo cache and reinstall:**  Run `expo cache:clear` to remove any potentially corrupted cached data.  Then, reinstall the necessary packages with `npm install` or `yarn install`.

4. **Update Expo CLI:**  Run `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli` to ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI. Newer versions often include bug fixes.

5. **Check environment variables:**  Certain environment variables can impact the behavior of Expo CLI. Make sure you don't have any conflicting settings.

6. **Examine the error message:** Carefully read the complete error message. It should provide clues as to where the problem lies.  Often, the error message will indicate a specific file or package causing the trouble. 

7. **Restart your machine:** A simple restart can solve temporary system glitches that may interfere with Expo CLI.

8. **Reinstall Expo CLI:**  As a last resort, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Expo CLI. Be sure to remove any existing global installations before reinstalling.

Example (Illustrative):

In the `expoBug.js` file, we might have a missing dependency that causes an error. The `expoBugSolution.js` file fixes this:

// expoBug.js
//import { useFonts } from 'expo-font'; //Missing dependency

// expoBugSolution.js
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';
// ... rest of the code
